# dotfiles
Configuration files

*Feb 2018 - a work in progress, spooling up a new work environment*

A handful of configuration files supporting my almost all text work environment; 99% of my time is spent in a terminal window or Neovim and I use a simple tiling window manager.

Retired LMDE 2 "Betsy" in favour of Debian direct; currently running Debian stretch (9.3). Little in this will be Debian centric.

User config files for:

* Neovim
* Neovim plugins 

TODO:
* X / [dwm](http://suckless.org/dwm) window manager
* System configuration for:
	* /etc/bash.bashrc

## Installation

As a regular user run `./setup-dotfiles.sh`.
