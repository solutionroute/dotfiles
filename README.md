Changes

- May 2020 Updated Neovim configuration; much simpler than any I've had before
  yet with full working Golang (and other langs) completion.
- 2020 Running Pop OS Desktop, Debian servers, and Windows... sometimes. More
  VS Code than Vim/Neovim as of late but Nvim remains an important tool.
- Parked old configs and scripts off in a branch.
