Changes

- May 2020 Updated Neovim configuration; much simpler than any I've had before
  yet with full working Golang (and other langs) completion.
- 2020 Running Pop OS Desktop, Debian servers, and Windows... sometimes. More
  VS Code than Vim/Neovim as of late but neovim/vim remains an important tool for me and part of my muscle memory.
- Parked old configs and scripts off in a branch.

## Neovim

See the [config/nvim/README](./config/nvim/README.md). You'll find in `init.md` a fairly trum configuration with working `gopls` autocompletion. Easy to install, almost completely automated thanks to others. Everything just works on:

    nvim -version
    NVIM v0.4.3
